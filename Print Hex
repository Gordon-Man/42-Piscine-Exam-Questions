/*
check if given integer is greater than or equal to 16, that is our base case.

modulo 16 gives us a number between 0 and 15

if its greater than 9, we have to convert it to a character between a and f, 

we also know that the number will be 15 or less due to % 16,

so adding 87 to any number between 10 and 15 will give us the corresponding a-f character. 

otherwise if its 0-9, just add '0' for the corresponding character

once we get our character, we print.
